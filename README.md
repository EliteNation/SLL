# SLL
Scannable Laser Lighting

---

## How it works:
Sensor I/O: Sensors send and receive data from an area scan to determine objects for avoidance.

Lighting Output: A grid with multiple laser pointers aim towards all areas outside of the avoidance area.

---

## What's the benefit to this:
Using this will maximise visibility, while avoiding blinding indviduals outside of your driving zone (ie. people, cars)
